To create a choices prompt you will need to use the /choice chat command
You can provide additional parameters to both the choice and the option with this syntax [param=value]
The first line of the chat message (the one with /choice) is the question, every new line will be one option
Example:
/choice [img=path/to/my/image.jpg][player=Jhon,Mary] What path will you chose?
[scene=path1] The Woods
[scene=rockymountains] The Mountains

Accepted parameters (all in the format [param=value])

Choice (the first line of the message)

multi - true or false, determines if multiple choices can be selected (default false)
img - the path to the image to be displayed as the background
sound - the sound to be played when the choice is displayed (the sound will loop and stop when the choice ends)
portraits - a comma separaded list of actor names, actor ids or image paths (you can mix an match) - these images will be displayed in the choice (theatre inserts style, if the actor has a theatre insert specific image, that will be used instead)
player - a comma separated list of player names, if not provided all players will get to chose
democracy - true or false, determine if the choice with the highest votes will be picked (if true) or resolve the choice per player (if false) (default true)
default - the default choice if no choice is made (default 0)
displayResult - true or false, determine if the result will be output to chat after the choice is made (default true)
resolveGM - true or false, determine if the resolution of the choice should run on the gm side as well (default false)

Options

scene - a scene name or id, when the choice is resolved this scene will be viewed
macro - a macro name or id, when the choice is resolved this macro will be executed, if you have the advanced macros module you can provide a comma separated list of args to be passed to the macro (eg [macro=myMacro,arg0,arg1])
sound - a sound file path, when the choice is resolved this sound will be played once
chain - set to true if this options triggers a macro with a choice

For your consideration

You can use some neat trick to get more use out of this module, for example you can create a choice with no choices to just display portraits on a background :)

Note on chaining - 
If you want to chain choices, the choice needs to have democracy=true and resolveGM=true , any option that calls another choice needs to have chain=true
